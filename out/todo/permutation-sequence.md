# Permutation Sequence

[https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence)

## 问题描述

The set `[1,2,3,...,`_`n`_`]` contains a total of _n_! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for _n_ = 3:

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`

Given _n_ and _k_, return the _k_th permutation sequence.

**Note:**

* Given _n_ will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
* Given _k_ will be between 1 and _n_! inclusive.

**Example 1:**

```text

Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

**Example 2:**

```text

Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```
